MUHAMMAD OMAR  MUHDHAR
January 2025 - February 2025 •Financial Data Analysis & Modeling: Managed fund administration for four private equity funds ($1B+  
assets). Extracted and analyzed financial data from PDFs, calculated N et Asset Value using Excel models, and 
recorded data in Investran. Developed Excel VBA solutions for transaction reconciliation and supported third-
party auditors.
•Data Management & Process Improvement: Identified workflow gaps causing $2M  worth of reporting errors 
in private equity accounting  operations; designed and deployed a Power Apps -SharePoint pipeline with metadata  
forms, automated routing, and approvals. Enhanced data capture, traceability, and audit readiness, ensuring  
accurate financial reporting.
•Performance Monitoring & Reporting : Created automated data pipelines using Microsoft Power Automate to  
streamline performance-related email requests and schedule recurring reports for private equity fund operations.  
Reduced manual report preparation time from 3 hours to minutes
•Government Systems & Vendor Invoice Processing: During a 2-month SAM.gov consulting engagement,  
resolved invoice processing backlogs by migrating financial data into organized Excel spreadsheets and creating  
systematic workflows for data extraction, validation, and vendor payment processing.May 2025  +1-817-918-5961 muhammad_muhdhar@berkeley.edu https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-omar-muhdhar/

TECHNICAL SKILLS
•Programming & Data Engineering:  Python, SQL, R, Excel, Azure SQL Server, Azure Cosmos DB
•Business Systems & Workflow Automation : Power Automate, Power Apps, SharePoint, Tableau , Power BI
RESEARCH PROJECTS 
Housing Displacement Risk Analysis for Climate-Vulnerable Populations
•Policy Research & Analysis : Conducted economic and policy analysis to assess housing displacement risks 
among climate-vulnerable populations, focusing on income disparities and housing cost burdens across racial, 
ethnic, and socioeconomic groups.
•Quantitative Data Analysis & Visualization: Used Excel and R for statistical analysis of housing burden and 
eviction risks across demographics. Created demographic maps and temporal trend charts to clearly 
communicate insights, making complex data accessible for decision-makers.
•Multi-Source Database Development: Compiled and harmonized census tract-level data from the American 
Community Survey and Eviction Lab, to assess risk for 1.78 million residents.September 2022

 •Data Pipeline Development : Integrated multiple third-party APIs (OpenAlex, CrossRef, PubMed) to build a 
centralized poverty studies database in Google BigQuery, developing a Python-based ETL pipeline to extract 
and process metadata for 500,000+ academic papers spanning two decades.
•Processing & Structuring Unstructured  Data: Built a transformer-based classification model trained on a  
small, annotated corpus to label research papers by topic, enabling structured analysis of academic literature.
•Interactive Dashboard Design: Created a Streamlit dashboard with bar charts, contour graphs, Sankey  
diagrams, and density maps to visualize topic distributions and surface emerging research trends in real time.January 2025 - May 2025 •Data Cleaning and Processing:  Processed and validated remote work data covering 110,000+ California state
employees . Developed data validation procedures and derived metrics such as commute patterns, time savings,
and resource allocation.
•Forecasting and Scenario Analysis: Utilized  statistical  models to assess financial and operational impacts of  
remote work policies, forecasting increases in commute time, miles, and fuel costs under 2-, 3-, and 4-day in-  
office scenarios.
•Report Creation and Visualization using Tableau: Designed  a report utiliz ing Tableau to communicate
workforce policy impacts, including time-series remote work trends, emissions projections, and financial
summaries.May 2025•Geospatial Data Engineering : Utilized python to develop a GIS data engineering workflow to rescale and 
harmonize demographic, spatial, and water-use data across inconsistent geographic boundaries (e.g., census 
tracts, water service areas).
•Integration of Remote Sensing Data (Light Density from Google Earth): Integrated remote sensing data, 
specifically nighttime light density from Google Earth Engine, to model intra-unit population distribution. This  
improved granularity and accuracy in representing population density within irregular spatial units.
•Documentation & Knowledge Transfer: Created clear technical documentation to ensure reproducibility of 
the GIS workflow. Supported capacity-building efforts by preparing handoff materials and walkthroughs to 
enable adoption of methods by internal teams.
