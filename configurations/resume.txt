PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Data Scientist Intern, Center for Effective Global Action
•
•
•
•
January 2025 - May 2025
• Integrated multiple third-party APIs (OpenAlex, CrossRef, PubMed) to build a centralized poverty studies
database in Google BigQuery, developing a Python-based ETL pipeline to extract and process metadata for
500,000+ academic papers spanning two decades.
• Developed a Python classification system using scikit-learn to automatically categorize and filter research papers.
• Designed a Streamlit dashboard interface that displays the categorized research data via interactive visualizations,
enabling stakeholders to extract research intelligence for evidence-driven research prioritization.
• Managed the complete project lifecycle; defining requirements with stakeholders, overseeing architecture,
implementing quality control measures, and conducting user training for platform adoption.




Business Analyst, Ernst & Young Business Consulting
•
•
•
•
July 2022 - August 2024
Financial Data Analysis & Modeling: Managed fund administration for four private equity funds ($1B+
assets). Extracted and analyzed financial data from PDFs, calculated Net Asset Value using Excel models, and
recorded data in Investran. Developed Excel VBA solutions for transaction reconciliation and supported thirdparty auditors.
Data Management & Process Improvement: Identified workflow gaps causing $2M worth of reporting errors
in private equity accounting operations; designed and deployed a Power Apps-SharePoint pipeline with metadata
forms, automated routing, and approvals. Enhanced data capture, traceability, and audit readiness, ensuring
accurate financial reporting.
Performance Monitoring & Reporting: Created automated data pipelines using Microsoft Power Automate to
streamline performance-related email requests and schedule recurring reports for private equity fund operations.
Reduced manual report preparation time from 3 hours to minutes
Government Systems & Vendor Invoice Processing: During a 2-month SAM.gov consulting engagement,
resolved invoice processing backlogs by migrating financial data into organized Excel spreadsheets and creating
systematic workflows for data extraction, validation, and vendor payment processing.

RESEARCH PROJECTS
January 2025 - February 2025
Housing Displacement Risk Analysis for Climate-Vulnerable Populations
• Policy Research & Analysis: Conducted economic and policy analysis to assess housing displacement risks
among climate-vulnerable populations, focusing on income disparities and housing cost burdens across racial,
ethnic, and socioeconomic groups.
• Quantitative Data Analysis & Visualization: Used Excel and R for statistical analysis of housing burden and
eviction risks across demographics. Created demographic maps and temporal trend charts to clearly
communicate insights, making complex data accessible for decision-makers.
• Multi-Source Database Development: Compiled and harmonized census tract-level data from the American
Community Survey and Eviction Lab, to assess risk for 1.78 million residents.
Psychology of Poverty Literature Dashboard, Center for Effective Global Action

Demographic Modeling, California State Water Resources Control Board

January 2025 - May 2025

• Geospatial Data Engineering: Utilized python to develop a GIS data engineering workflow to rescale and
harmonize demographic, spatial, and water-use data across inconsistent geographic boundaries (e.g., census
tracts, water service areas).
• Integration of Remote Sensing Data (Light Density from Google Earth): Integrated remote sensing data,
specifically nighttime light density from Google Earth Engine, to model intra-unit population distribution. This
improved granularity and accuracy in representing population density within irregular spatial units.
• Documentation & Knowledge Transfer: Created clear technical documentation to ensure reproducibility of
the GIS workflow. Supported capacity-building efforts by preparing handoff materials and walkthroughs to
enable adoption of methods by internal teams.
California State Employee Return-to-Office Impact Analysis

May 2025

• Data Cleaning and Processing: Processed and validated remote work data covering 110,000+ California state
employees. Developed data validation procedures and derived metrics such as commute patterns, time savings,
and resource allocation.
• Forecasting and Scenario Analysis: Utilized statistical models to assess financial and operational impacts of
remote work policies, forecasting increases in commute time, miles, and fuel costs under 2-, 3-, and 4-day inoffice scenarios.
• Report Creation and Visualization using Tableau: Designed a report utilizing Tableau to communicate
workforce policy impacts, including time-series remote work trends, emissions projections, and financial
summaries.
