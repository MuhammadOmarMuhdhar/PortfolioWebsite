Economic Lessons From the FIFA World Cup on Brazil 
•Extracted economic and environmental data from IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e
Estatística) and World Bank APIs, automating the data retrieval process for population growth, GDP
(overall and by industry), unemployment rates, and carbon emissions.
•Assessed the causal effects of hosting the 2014 FIFA World Cup on host states versus non-host states
through Difference-in-Differences (DiD) and Synthetic Control Method (SCM) analysis, evaluating
key economic and environmental indicators to measure short- and long-term impacts.
•Presented findings in a comprehensive policy memo, highlighting the socio-economic trade-offs and
environmental consequences of hosting the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Developed actionable
recommendations for the United States, using lessons from the analysis to guide future strategies for
planning sustainable mega-events.

•Conducted a research study evaluating the societal implications of Western and Chinese foreign aid in  
Uganda. The investigation focused on understanding the rise of China as a global power and its emergence as  
a novel aid source in Uganda, exploring the self-interested nature of Chinese aid in comparison to the  
altruistic portrayal of Western aid.
•Utilized Qualtrics to conduct a survey experiment distributed to 1000 respondents, demonstrating proficiency  
in handling extensive datasets and employing quantitative methodologies.
•Leveraged R programming to implement advanced statistical methodologies, including t-tests, in the analysis  
of survey data. Emphasizing a causal analysis approach, the study sought to  unravel the  cause-and-effect  
relationships within the socio-economic landscape of foreign aid in  Uganda.
