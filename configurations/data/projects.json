        "Description": "Built an automated ETL pipeline integrating OpenAlex and CrossRef APIs to extract research paper metadata into Google Sheets. Developed a transformer-based classification model to categorize academic papers by topic using annotated corpus, and leveraged Gemini LLMs to generate narrative summaries for strategic decision-making. Created an interactive Streamlit dashboard with contour graphs and density maps visualizing topic distributions and research trends. Collaborated cross-functionally through iterative user testing to ensure accessibility for non-technical stakeholders.",

        "Description": "Analyzed housing displacement risk among climate-vulnerable populations, focusing on income disparities and housing cost burdens across demographic groups. Performed statistical analysis in R to evaluate housing burden and eviction risk patterns, creating demographic maps and temporal charts. Compiled multi-source datasets from American Community Survey and Eviction Lab at census tract level, designing database architecture for scalable risk assessment across 1.78 million residents. Delivered comprehensive reports with data-driven policy recommendations for environmental and social justice goals.",

Automated data retrieval using APIs and conducted Difference-in-Differences (DiD) and Synthetic Control Method (SCM) analyses to assess causal effects on host versus non-host states. Created policy memo with recommendations for sustainable mega-event planning.",

        "Description": "Develops methodology for rescaling demographic and spatial data between geographic boundaries while accounting for intra-unit population density variations. Unlike traditional areal interpolation assuming uniform distribution, incorporates auxiliary data (nighttime lights, building density, traffic patterns) to estimate sub-unit density variations. Particularly valuable for transforming data between disparate boundary systems (census tracts to watersheds) with heterogeneous population distribution. Demonstrates significant accuracy improvements over conventional area-weighted approaches in diverse land use regions.",
