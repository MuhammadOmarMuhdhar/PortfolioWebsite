        "Description": "This project analyzed the economic and environmental impacts of hosting the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Key tasks included automating data retrieval using APIs, conducting Difference-in-Differences (DiD) and Synthetic Control Method (SCM) analyses to assess causal effects on host states versus non-host states, and creating a policy memo with recommendations for sustainable mega-event planning.",

        "Description": "This project explores the potential application of topic modeling within social science research. Using IMDB reviews of the Netflix series *Squid Game* as a case study, the project demonstrates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be tailored for causal explanatory purposes. The key contribution of this project is a methodology for statistically validating topic models by measuring their ability to explain behavioral outcomes - in this case, how BERTopic discovered discussion themes in reviews explain user ratings of the show Squid Game.

        "Key-words": "Data Engineering, GIS, GeoPandas, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)",
        "Description": "This project develops a methodology for rescaling demographic and spatial data between different geographic boundaries while accounting for intra-unit population density variations. Unlike traditional areal interpolation methods that assume uniform distribution within source units, this approach incorporates auxiliary data (e.g., nighttime lights, building density, traffic patterns) to estimate sub-unit population density variations. The methodology is particularly valuable when transforming data between disparate boundary systems (e.g., census tracts to watersheds) where population distribution is highly heterogeneous. The project demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to conventional area-weighted approaches, especially in regions with diverse land use patterns and varying population densities.",
