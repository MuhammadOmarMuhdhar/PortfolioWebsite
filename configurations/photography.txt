Muhammad O. MuhdharHi, I’m Muhammad Omar Muhdhar, a 
photographer based in Oakland, California. For 
nearly a decade, I’ve been capturing moments and 
stories through my lens.  
In this portfolio document, you’ll find a curated 
collection of images that reflect my journey and 
artistic vision. Some photographs are accompanied 
by descriptions to offer context, while others are 
left open to your interpretation, inviting you to 
imagine their stories. My goal is to gradually reveal 
the elements that define my photographic style and 
shape my vision of photography.I begin this gallery with an 
image that holds  a special 
place in my heart. 
This 
images mark a pivotal 
moment in my journey as a 
photographer. Captured in 
April 2021, this photo is the 
result of a 6 hour road trip 
with my friends Joe and 
Michelle to a desert 
location
.
This was a turning point in 
my Photography. I began to 
see my work in a new light 
and started to consider 
myself a fine art 
photographer. I hope this 
photo resonates with you as 
as it does with me.Fine art photography to me is 
about vision and intention in 
how a subject or scene  is 
captured. 
My work is personal and 
driven by how I view the 
world. I am not influenced by 
commissions or external 
directives. Art outside the Art MuseumlO
